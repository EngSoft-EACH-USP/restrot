Feature: Ingredients and Receipts Visualization
  In order to manage my ingredients and see receipts
  As a user
  I want to see these items in my dashboard
  
    #Scenario: See ingredients list
       #Given I am a registered user with the username "any_name" and password "123456"
        #And I am on "users/login"
        #When I fill in user_name with "any_name"
        #And I fill in user_password with "123456"
        #And I press "Login"
        #And I should be on "dashboard/dashboard"
        #When I go to my ingredients dashboard
        #Then I should see my list of ingredients
